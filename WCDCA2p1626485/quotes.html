	<h2 class="quoteH2">Hey everybody! This page is filled with some of my favourite quotes! Some of them are even mine! Most of these  are from video games! Who says video game don't teach you anything huh?</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Your friends... What kind of... people are they? I wonder... Do those people... think of you... as a friend?" </p>
		<cite>Moon Child (Odolwa's mask), Majora's Mask</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: This quote does make you think doesn't it? You consider your friends well...friends. But...do they consider you the same way? Are they really your friends? Is it just your imagination?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"The right thing... What is it? I wonder... If you do the right thing... Does it really make... everybody...happy?"</p>
		<cite>Moon Child (Gyorg's mask), Majora's Mask</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion"> My thoughts: Does doing the right thing really make people happy? We see shows where doing good will make people smile but is it true? If so, why does doing bad make some smile? Given a choice, which will you choose, make people happy or do the right thing?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Your true face... What kind of... face is it? I wonder... The face under the mask... Is that... your true face? "</p>
		<cite> Moon Child (Twinmold's mask), Majora's Mask</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: This quote hits deep in the question zone. We all wear a 'mask' that hides who we really are. In this world we live in, people try to change themselves to fit Society's ideals. We wear a 'mask' that hides who we truly are. Are you who you really are?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"A sword wields no strength unless the hand that holds it has courage."</p>
		<cite>Hero's Shade, Twilight Princess</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: That's true. What use is wielding a weapon when you're too scared to use it to protect yourself? It may be the most powerful weapon for all I care, but if you don't have the courage...you are dead.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Dance with me! Born in a world of strife! Against the odds! We choose to fight! Blossom Dance!</p>
		<cite>Dunban, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: An epic battle quote. When things seem to be going against you, fight it. Nuff said </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Your blade...It did not cut deep enough."</p>
		<cite> Egil, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Oh man! This quote! Not just that but the scene! In it, Egil takes out the Monado that was stabbed deep into him. "Wait, if the Monado was stabbed deep into him, then why did he say it did not cut deep enough?" Well 1, to sound like a badass and 2, there is another meaning to this quote. You see, the main protagonist Shulk and his friends wanted Egil to stop harming their people. However, they failed to convince Egil to stop. Hence their words='your blade' did not have an impact on Egil. You just gotta watch it to see the pure epicness! </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"This new world is boundless. It is home to not only you, but many forms of life. I can see it. In this world, all life will walk towards the future, hand in hand."</p>
		<cite>Alvis, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Ah this quote! Admit it, in our world, there are many different walks of life. Different race, different religion, yet we are always attacking one another. Humans wish to feel superior than other people. We shouldn't do that. Instead, we should live together in peace, we face any trouble together. We walk towards the future, hand in hand, no matter your race or religion, whether you are handicapped or not.</p>

	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"We may die if we take a stand here. But staying gives us the chance to change our destinies"</p>
		<cite>Dunban, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Dunban, one of the most epic and badass character of all time. If you want to achieve something, you must first take the risk. That is what this quote means </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"The future we see is not set in stone. There are infinite possibilities based on the paths we choose."</p>
		<cite>Fiora, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Yes, we are not bound to a single path in our life. There are many choices to choose. Which path will you walk? Will that path lead to a good future or a bad one? </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"It's the will to make a choice and the strength to seize your destiny"</p>
		<cite>Shulk, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Never let fate dictate your life. You have the power to decide how your life shall be. (Don't do bad though) </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"On my business card, I am a corporate president. In my mind, I am a game developer. But in my heart, I am a gamer."</p>
		<cite> Satoru Iwata</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Oh the feels!! Rest In Peace Iwata. You will be missed! In the arms of an angel</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"We're not pawns of some scripted fate. It's the invisible ties we forge that bind us."</p>
		<cite>Morgan, Fire Emblem Awakening</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: It's hard to describe honestly. Our lives isn't based on a script, The friendship we have with one another is what pushes us on.</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant. It is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are."</p>
		<cite>Mewtwo, Pokemon</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: I'm gonna use someone else's reaction(with a few edit) to this. Ahem...Ghandi didn't say this, Martin Luther King Jr. didn't say this. Mewtwo said this enlighting quote! </p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Whenever there is a meeting, a parting is sure to follow. However, that parting need not last forever... Whether a parting be forever or merely for a short time... That is up to you."</p>
		<cite>Happy Mask Salesman, Majora's Mask</cite>
		<br>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: I actually heard that one guy used this in his literature test and he got and A. Damn right that guy deserves and A! Look at how deep the quote is! I don't even need to explain it now do I?</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Focus on what you can become rather than focus on what you are now"</p>
		<cite>Me</cite>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Show the world your true self. Be who you are. Be unique and not a copy and paste. Remove the mask that hides your true face, then the world shall know your name"</p>
		<cite>Me</cite>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Nothing that exists is perfect. It is a sad truth, but you can learn from it and begin the journey on a new path."</p>
		<cite>Alvis, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: Too true</p>
	</blockquote>
	<blockquote>
		<p class="quote">"Do you wish to change it? The future. It is every man's desire to change the future. Is that not so? Even if everything has been predestined, will you not oppose it?"</p>
		<cite>Alvis, Xenoblade Chronicles</cite>
		<p class="opinion">My thoughts: This. THIS is my favourite quote of all time. Alvis doesn't just ask the main protagonist Shulk this question. He indirectly asks the player as well. Do you wish to know how the future will turn out and be able to change it to make things go your way? Or not know what the future holds and let the future surprise you? </p>
